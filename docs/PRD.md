# Product requirements — systemlens

## At a glance

SystemLens gives coding agents and developers a trustworthy, local architecture
inventory before a Java/Spring change. Its defining rule is simple: preserve
evidence and uncertainty; do not guess dependencies.

| Audience | Primary outcome |
|---|---|
| Coding agent | Bounded, evidenced context before an edit |
| Developer | A navigable inventory of services and integrations |
| Architect | A reviewable topology with visible uncertainty |

## Purpose

`systemlens` gives coding agents trustworthy, local architecture context before
they modify a Java/Spring system. Developers and architects use the same
evidence to inspect and review the result. It derives source facts directly
from local ASTs, without starting an external rule engine or sending source
code to a service.

The product answers questions such as:

- Which services expose or call an HTTP API?
- Which Kafka topics are produced and consumed, and with which payload type?
- What are the dependencies and likely impact paths between services?
- Which Maven/Gradle projects, OpenAPI contracts, MongoDB collections and
  Spring properties belong to a service?

## Users and primary workflows

| User | Need | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| Coding agent (primary) | Establish proven dependencies, impact and unresolved facts before an edit | MCP tools |
| Developer | Inspect the evidence behind a service, API, topic, project or architecture module | CLI catalog commands and HTML export |
| Architect | Review topology, uncertainty and static architecture risks across services | `analyze`, graph export |

The primary workflow is `systemlens init`, `systemlens index`, then an agent
uses the MCP catalog, graph, coverage and trace tools before making a bounded
change. Source evidence is available from the catalog and graph; coverage and
indexing-issue tools expose unresolved facts. The agent then reindexes after
the edit. Developers can follow the same workflow through `microservices`,
`topics`, `apis`, `projects`, `analyze`, and HTML export. Indexing is
incremental; `--full` refreshes every eligible source file.

## Scope and non-goals

### Delivered

- Tree-sitter Java AST extraction for Spring MVC/WebFlux, Feign,
  RestTemplate/WebClient, Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring Data REST endpoints.
- Kafka producers and consumers, dynamic-topic evidence and explicit Java
  payload types.
- Maven/Gradle project discovery, OpenAPI and MongoDB inventory.
- Local SQLite persistence, architecture relations, graph/audit views and
  workspace federation.
- Markdown/JSON Kafka manifests and the opt-in Strategy1 conventions.
- Optional Kubernetes Deployment and StatefulSet resource dimensions from the
  active local `kubectl` context, matched conservatively to indexed projects.

### Planned

- Conservative presentation of observed HTTP, Kafka, MongoDB, and S3 activity
  beside the static architecture, without inventing a source mapping.
- Explicit Kubernetes capacity context for runtime hotspots where a verified
  workload-to-service match exists. A future matcher must prefer an exact name,
  then accept a unique token-bounded service-name inclusion in a Deployment or
  StatefulSet name; ambiguous matches remain unresolved.

### Not delivered

- Security or quality scans, severity filtering or automated remediation.
- Guaranteed resolution of dynamic values; unresolved values remain explicitly
  marked as dynamic rather than guessed.

## Product requirements

1. Source facts must be derived from local AST parsing and deterministic local
   configuration only. Optional Kubernetes enrichment is opt-in, retains its
   workload kind, namespace, and name, and never replaces source evidence.
2. Each source fact must carry enough evidence to navigate to its file and line
   range. Every non-source enrichment must identify its acquisition origin.
3. A changed or deleted source file must update or remove its facts on the next
   index run.
4. The local inventory and its CLI and MCP queries must operate without network
   access once indexing is complete. Kubernetes discovery is an opt-in network
   exception.
5. Graph, catalog and audit output must make uncertainty visible rather than
   inventing a dependency.
6. An agent must be able to obtain a bounded answer, evidence and unresolved
   facts before it changes a supported Java/Spring integration.

## Success measures

- On each supported reference repository, an MCP client can answer the primary
  pre-edit questions (service dependencies, HTTP APIs, Kafka flow and impact)
  after one local index, with a bounded result and its evidence.
- Every emitted source integration is traceable to a concrete source location
  or an explicitly named manifest entry; optional Kubernetes facts identify the
  matched workload kind, namespace, and name.
- Coverage output distinguishes resolved relations from unresolved or dynamic
  facts, so an agent can decline to assume a missing dependency.
- Incremental indexing touches only changed files unless an extractor signature,
  selected convention, or an analysis dependency (Spring configuration or build
  descriptor) changes.
- For a selected runtime window, a developer can identify the highest-ranked
  latency and error hotspots, determine the completeness of the observation,
  and navigate only to explicitly linked static evidence.
